# Good and Bad Tests

## Good Tests

**Integration-style**: Test through real interfaces, not mocks of internal parts.

```python
# GOOD: Tests observable behavior
def test_user_can_checkout_with_valid_cart():
    cart = create_cart()
    cart.add(product)
    result = checkout(cart, payment_method)
    assert result.status == "confirmed"
```

Characteristics:

- Tests behavior users/callers care about
- Uses public API only
- Survives internal refactors
- Describes WHAT, not HOW
- One logical assertion per test

## Bad Tests

**Implementation-detail tests**: Coupled to internal structure.

```python
# BAD: Tests implementation details
def test_checkout_calls_payment_service():
    mock_payment = MagicMock()
    checkout(cart, mock_payment)
    mock_payment.process.assert_called_once_with(cart.total)
```

Red flags:

- Mocking internal collaborators
- Testing private methods
- Asserting on call counts/order
- Test breaks when refactoring without behavior change
- Test name describes HOW not WHAT
- Verifying through external means instead of interface
